Perfect foundation for your dApp, NFT, or token ecosystem front end.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with **[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)** and styled using **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**.

### 🔧 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

> Starts the app in development mode.  
> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload on save. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### `yarn test`

> Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
> See the official [testing docs](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

---

### `yarn build`

> Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
> It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

✅ Minifies the code  
✅ Includes content hashes for caching  
✅ Ready for deployment

### ⚠️ `yarn eject`

> **Warning:** This is a one-way operation!

If you want full control over the config (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can eject:

```bash
yarn eject
```


**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
